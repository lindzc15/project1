    <h2>So Sleepy: A Haiku</h2>
    <p>I wrote this haiku while I was doing homework:
    <p>
    <div>
        </p><br>I am just so tired<br>I wish I could go to bed<br>But alas
        I
        must work</p>
    </div>

    <h2>My personal interests</h2>
    <p>One of my hobbies is knitting/crocheting. I started with knitting in 2020. I saw a cardigan that
        Harry Styles had worn, and I wanted to teach myself to knit so I could recreate it. I ended up really
        enjoying knitting and stuck with the hobby. A few years later, I picked up crochet. I now knit/crochet
        frequently and have made some items I really love.
    </p>
    <p>Another interest of mine is dance. I started dancing when I was three years old. I absolutley loved it
        and continued to dance competitively until I was 18. Although I no longer dance frequently, I still enjoy
        taking a class here and there or going to a show.
    </p>
    <p>Another thing I enjoy is baking. I find it to be a very comforting and relaxing activity. I started baking
        with my mom when I was a child. My love for baking has continued through into adulthood. One of my favorite
        things to bake is banana bread.
